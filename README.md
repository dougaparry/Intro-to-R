# Intro-to-R
Data, code, images, and markdown files for an introduction to R.

To access either clone the repository or (recommended) download to your desktop as a zip file. Unpack this zip file and open `Introduction_to_R.Rproj`. If you have Rstudio installed (if not: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) this will open the project in RStudio. Each .Rmd file corresponds to a session. The first lesson is `1.3_transform.Rmd`.

The sessions are built around the book R 4 Data Science (https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham.
