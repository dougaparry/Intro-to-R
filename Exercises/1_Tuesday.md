# Tuesday Exercises

This session is based around chapter 5 of R 4 Data Science. It is important that you work through the chapter completely to understand all of the important concepts (both those covered in the session and the rest covered in the chapter). Afterwards, we have extracted a number of relevant exercises from the chapter to work through. For these exercises you can use the provided notebooks and data at: https://github.com/dougaparry/Intro-to-R to get started (download the full repo as a zip file). While the solutions for the exercises can be found on the Internet, we encourage you to work through the exercises using the chapter first to get used to solving problems with R.
